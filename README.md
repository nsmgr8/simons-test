Introduction
------------

Hello and welcome to Simon's coding exercise! I very much appreciate you taking
the time to work through the exercises and hope you enjoy doing them.

I expect that you should be able to complete the exercises within 2 hours.

In approaching your solution, write your code as if you intended to ship it to
production. Tests are expected. While it is great if you can answer the
exercises correctly, it is equally important that your code is clear, idiomatic
and maintainable.

I recommend that you use the language you are most comfortable with.

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out to us!

The Exercises
-------------
There are two exercises each with two parts. They are described in the files
problem1.txt and problem2.txt. Each exercise has a required input which can be
found in the input directory.

Please provide your answers in the exercise.txt files

Evaluation
-------------
I will use your answers as a measure of:
- How you can follow and implement a set of requirements
- Is the code you produce well written
- How you ensure your code is robust and working as expected
- How is your solution in terms of being efficient/concise/general
- Did you get the answers right! :-)
